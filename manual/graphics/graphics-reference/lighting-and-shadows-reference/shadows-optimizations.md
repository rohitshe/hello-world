# Shadows optimizations

The technique used to render shadows is called shadow mapping and consist in rendering to a depth texture from the point-of-view of the light all potential occluders, and then reuse this information to render the shadows along the rendering of the scene.

Internally, the engine is using a shadow map atlas texture for directional and spot lights.

Each lights with an enabled shadow gets a region of this map atlas texture.

The size of this region depends on several factors:

- The `shadowImportanceFactor` based on the `LightComponent.Importance` property:

| Shadow Importance | Shadow Importance Factor                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| High              | 2.0 (by default for Directional lights) |
| Medium            | 1.0 (by default for Spot lights)        |
| Low               | 0.5 (by default for Omni lights)        |


- The `shadowMapSizeFactor` based on the `LightComponent.Size` property:

| Shadow Size | Shadow Importance Factor |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Large       | 1.0                      |
| Medium      | 0.5                      |
| Small       | 0.25                     |


- The projected size of the light in screen-space (`lightSize`). 
  - For the directional light, the lightSize is equal to the max(screenWidth, screenHeight)
  - For the spot light, the lightSize is equal to the projection of the projected sphere at target spot light cone
- The `ShadowMapBaseSize` equals to `1024` (In 1.1.x-beta, it is currently hardcoded, but it will use a dynamic value based on the shader profile / GPU memory)

> In order to simplify the parametrization, the Shadow Importance property will be merged into the Shadow Size property in a future release.    

 

The final size of the shadow map is then calculated like this:

```cs
// Calculate the size factor
var shadowMapSizeFinalFactor = shadowImportanceFactor * shadowMapSizeFactor;
// Multiply the light projected size by the size factor
var shadowMapSize = NextPowerOfTwo(lightSize * shadowSizeFinalFactor);
// Clamp to a maximum size
shadowMapSize = min(shadowMapSize, ShadowMapBaseSize  * shadowSizeFinalFactor);```
