# Materials Reference

A Material defines the appearance of the surface of a 3D model and how it reacts to light. A Material can have an impact on both the geometry of a model (vertex shading) as well as on pixels (pixel shading).

A Material can use multiple layers of materials in order to build more complex materials.

In practice, a material will generate a partial definition of a Shader that will be integrated as part of the shading of a model (lighting and shadows).
