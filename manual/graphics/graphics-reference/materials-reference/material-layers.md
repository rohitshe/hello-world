# Material Layers

Material layers gives a powerful way to combine multiple materials to build more complex materials.

The following screenshot shows the blending of a rust material with a gold material.

The following diagram shows the definition of a material blend above:

| Property        | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Material        | A reference to a material                                                                                                                |
| Blend Map       | A blend map [scalar provider](material-colors.md) that defines how much the current material is blend to the previous one (upper layer). |
|                 |                                                                                                                                          |
|                 | - A value of 0 means that the previous material in the layer is fully used                                                               |
|                 | - A value of 1 means that the material referenced by this layer is fully used                                                            |
|                 | - Values in-between 0 and 1 will generate a blend of a parameters of the previous material with the material defined by this layer       |
|                 |                                                                                                                                          |
|                 |                                                                                                                                          |
| Layer Overrides |                                                                                                                                          |
| - UV Scale      | A UV scale applied to all textures UV of the material of the layer (excluding the occlusion map)                                         |
|                 |                                                                                                                                          |
|                 |                                                                                                                                          |
