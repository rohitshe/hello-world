# Classes, mixins and Inheritance

# Concept

Xenko Shading Language (XKSL) is an extension of HLSL which makes it closer to C# syntax and concepts. As a result, the language is object oriented :

- classes are the foundation of the code
- classes contain methods and members
- classes can be inherited, methods can be overridden
- members type can be classes

In addition to these straightforward concepts, XKSL uses a original way to handle multiple inheritance. Inheritance is performed through mixins, so the order of inheritance is crucial.

- the order of inheritance defines the actual implementation of a method (the last override)
- if a mixin appears several times in the inheritance, only the first occurrence will be taken into account (as well as its members and methods)
- it is possible to call the previous implementation of a method using `base.<method name>(<arguments>)`

# Keywords

XKSL uses the same set of keywords than HLSL but adds some new ones:

- `stage`: method and member keyword. This keyword ensures that the method or member is only defined once and is the same in the compositions.
- `stream`: member keyword. The member is accessible at every stage of the shader. [See this page](automatic-shader-stage-input-output.md).
- `streams`: sort of global structure storing variables needed across several stages of the shader.[See this page](automatic-shader-stage-input-output.md).
- `override`: method keyword. If this keyword is missing, the compilation will return an error.
- `abstract`: is used in front of a method declaration (without a body).
- `clone`: method keyword. When a method appears several times in the inheritance tree of class, this keyword forces the creation of multiple instances of the method at each level of the inheritance instead of one. [See this page](composition.md).
- `Input`: for geometry and tessellation shaders. [See this page](shader-stages.md).
- `Output`: for geometry and tessellation shaders. [See this page](shader-stages.md).
- `Input2`: for tessellation shader. [See this page](shader-stages.md).
- `Constants`: for tessellation shader. [See this page](shader-stages.md).

# Abstract methods

Abstract methods are available in XKSL. They should be prefixed with the `abstract` keyword. You can inherit from a class with abstract methods without having to implement them. The compiler will simply produce a harmless warning. However, it should be implemented in your final shader to prevent a compilation error.

# Annotations

Like in HLSL, annotations are availables in XKSL. Here are some the most useful ones:

- `[Color]` for float4 variables. The ParameterKey will have the type `Color4` instead of `Vector4`. It also specifies to GameStudio that this variable should be treated as a color, giving you the most convenient interface to edit it.
- `[Link(...)]` specifies which ParameterKey to use to set this value. However an independent default key is still created.
- `[Map(...)]` specifies which ParameterKey to use to set this value. No new ParameterKey will be created.
- `[RenameLink]` prevents the creation of a ParameterKey. It should be used with `[Link()]`.

**Code:** Annotations

```cs
class BaseClass
{
	[Color] float4 myColor;
 
	[Link("ProjectKeys.MyTextureKey")]
	[RenameLink]
	Texture2D texture;
 
	[Map("Texturing.Texture0")] Texture2D defaultTexture;
};```


# Inheritance example

**Code:** Example of inheritance

```cs
class BaseInterface
{
	abstract float Compute();
};
 
class BaseClass : BaseInterface
{
	float Compute()
	{
		return 1.0f;
	}
};
 
class ClassA : BaseClass
{
	override void Compute()
	{
		return 2.0f;
	}
};
 
class ClassB : BaseClass
{
	override void Compute()
	{
		float prevValue = base.Compute();
		return (5.0f + prevValue);
	}
};```


Now let's look at what happens when we change the inheritance order between `ClassA` and `ClassB`.

**Code:** Importance of inheritance order

```cs
class MixAB : ClassA, ClassB
{
};
 
class MixBA : ClassB, ClassA
{
};
 
// Resulting code (representation)

class MixAB : BaseInterface, BaseClass, ClassA, ClassB
{
	float Compute()
	{
		// code from BaseClass
		float v0 = 1.0f;
 
		// code from ClassA
		float v1 = 2.0f;
 
		// code from ClassB
		float prevValue = v1;
		float v2 = 5.0f + prevValue;
 
		return v2; // = 7.0f
	}
};

class MixBA : BaseInterface, BaseClass, ClassB, ClassA
{
	float Compute()
	{
		// code from BaseClass
		float v0 = 1.0f;

		// code from ClassB
		float prevValue = v0;
		float v1 = 5.0f + prevValue;
		
		// code from ClassA
		float v2 = 2.0f;

		return v2; // = 2.0f
	}
};```


# Static calls

It is also possible to use a variable or call a method from a class without having to inherit from it. Simply use `<class_name>.<variable or method_name>` in your code. It behaves the same way than a static call. However you should be aware that if you statically call a method that uses class variables, the shader will not compile. This is convenient way to only use a part of a shader but you shouldn't think this is an optimization. The shader compiler already automatically remove any unnecessary variables.

**Code:** Static calls

```cs
class StaticClass
{
	float StaticValue;
	float StaticMethod(float a)
	{
		return 2.0f * a;
	}
 
	// this method uses a
	float NonStaticMethod()
	{
		return 2.0f * StaticValue;
	}
};
 
// this class is fine
class CorrectStaticCallClass
{
	float Compute()
	{
		return StaticClass.StaticValue * StaticMethod(5.0f);
	}
};
 
// this class will not compile since the call is not static
class IncorrectStaticCallClass 
{
	float Compute()
	{
		return StaticClass.NonStaticMethod();
	}
};
 
// one way to fix this
class IncorrectStaticCallClassFixed : StaticClass
{
	float Compute()
	{
		return NonStaticMethod();
	}
};```
